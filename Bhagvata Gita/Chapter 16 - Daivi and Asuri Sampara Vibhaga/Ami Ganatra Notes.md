In this chapter, Krishna comes back from very advanced concept to very practical things. How do you achieve or practice purushottama yoga. 

You cannot just out of the blue start focusing on the parama tatva. 
Its a step by step process. 

Here in this chapter, Krishna is going to talk about two kinds of personalites - 
one with Daivi Sampara and other with Asuri Sampara. 

What is the essential difference between Dev and an asur? 

List of traits of Daivi Samparada:  
- A sense of shame because it allows you to be on the right path, a sense of shame towards things because it cannot be done. It's a sense of humility and a aversion from behaviors that should not be in your conduct. 
- Being a bit resolute in your choices, don't jump around too suddenly and too quickly. 
- and many more read the chapter for all of them 

List of traits of Asuri Samparada: 
 - *Dambha* - Hypocricy 
 - *Darba* - Lot of arrogance 
 - *Abhimana* - Haughty 
 - Parushyam - To insult/humiliate someone 
 - *Krodha* - Anger 
 - *Agyana* - Ignorance 

In the *vishwa*, we have both kind of personalities, and we can also think of these two extreme personalities as a spectrum and we lie between these two. 

In this chapter, Krishna is mainly going to focus on the Asuri Sampara 

Asuras don't know what should be done and what should not be done, they keep getting confused in that. They keep doing that should not be done and they keep avoiding what should be done. 

They don't have cleanliness of mind, body and speech, they speak lies, they don't focus on *Satya* Dharma - truth, in the sense of speaking the truth and performing actions which are in line to sustenence. 

They say that there is no God, They say that its just the union of man and woman that gives rise to the society. 

Sticking to the above opionion, they end up doing actions which are very aggressive, which leads to destruction of the world. 

Krishna says, that when we start believing that we can do whatever we want - we start believing that we can control everything and we are the masters. What does this lead to? Extreme Consumerism and exploitation of things that you don't consider similar to you. 

Now it is to be noted that: In certain philosophies there may be concept of god, but they put humans over anything else and say that humans are the masters of everything and have the right to enjoy everything they desire. 

What does this leads to ? Exploitation of nature, Exploitation of others, Slavery .... 

Carvakas who believe in pratayaksha pramana, say that just because you don't believe in existence of god, doesn't mean that you will become asuri. 

But there are shit elements everywhere: 
- They say there's one life, indulge into every pleasure you possibly can, if you don't have ghee, take a loan and drink it, who cares who pays for it, you have one life, enjoy it as much as you can because you won't know when you will die 
- Then there is another category, which believe in god, but they think they themselves are god and cannot be killed and this category is worse 

But krishna says, if you don't have that karma-fala tyaga and some rememberance of the divine, this is what, it all will lead to.

So Asuri are who live this kind of undisciplined life because they deny anything that is beyond of what is in their observable universe. 

The Asuris have lot of indulgences and desires, they have a lot of pride and ego. They will keep stressing over small small things. There life is only about indulgence and enjoying. 

They are tied in this trap of desires. We will die but the *Trishna* will never die. So we have to stop somewhere. 

How will Asuri people talk? 
 - You see how I achieved this? Now, I will achieve this desire of mine too. 
There's another kind of asuri as well - 
 - You see how I killed/opressed my enemies, I am only the god, nobody can come close to me, I have achieved everything, I am the acompolished one, I am very strong and I am very happy. Like Ravana, HrinyaKashipu
- I have all the money in the world, I have a huge family, who is like me, I will conduct lot of yagnas, I will give lot of dana also. 
Even, if these people do yagnas/puja, to gain more and more power, to gain more and more physical pleasure, to gain more and more strength, and ultimately this is the strength that leads to their downfall. 

Its not like people like Ravana, HiranyaKashipu, Kumbha, Nikumbha did not have knowledge, a sense of intelligence, power. They couldn't have achieved what they have achieved, if they didn't have that. It was the lack of anchoring into the parama tatva, is what lead to their downfall. 

In Ramayana, They have used great adjectives of Ravana, but eventually when he dies, there is beautiful piece which comes, Mandodri is lamenting after Ravana is dead and she says, 
```
Once upon a time you controlled all your senses, and you won over the tri-bhuvana, Your indriyas remembered that you had controlled them. So they took over you and enslaved you and that is what lead to your downfall. 
```

Once, you are overcome by asuri characterisitics, your fall is guaranteed. 

Krishna says that people full of anger, ego despise and become ignorant of the parama tatva, and what do I do of those people? 
Eventually, I throw them in asuri yonis and they have to keep going through this sukha-dukha and they are stuck into this chakra. 

Hence, Arjuna please remember this: 

Remember the three doors to the downfall of anybody: Kama, Krodha, Lobha
So, be aware of them, and keep away. Once, you are free of them, you come to me. 

Hence, how should a person behave? Do as the shastras tell you.
