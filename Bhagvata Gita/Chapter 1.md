Shruti - Veda 
Smriti - Itihasa, Purana, Darshana
Upnishads - For Existential questions, but they end vedas

 3 main texts -> PrasthanTreyi = Upnishads, BrahmaSutra, Bhagvata Gita that summarise Sanatana Dharama

- Upnishads, BrahmaSutra is given in a Gurukul after AranyaKanda
- Bhagvata Gita was taught in a battle field and still it is called a Moksha Shastra. 
- Krishna milks Upnishads and put it into Gita and learned people have eventually relished that amrit. 
- Gita is both Moksha Shastra and Yoga Shastra 
- Across different Darshanas -> Punar Janama is accepted as a Sidhaanta
- Karana is a Grehsta who wants to run away and become a monk.
- How do you navigate through Dharama Sankatas in life? That's what one part of Gita
- War is a situation that we should never be in. It should be the last resort. Both side gets destroyed. 
- Pandavas wanted 5 gaons, Duryodhan said he would not give you even a single needle of worth of land. I just can't live with you lot. 
- Matsya Nyaya - Jungle Rule, Survival of the fittest 
- MahaBharata happened because Matsya Nyaya happened. 

# Start of Gita 
- Gita starts from Dhritrashtra. 
- Most people avoid the first chapter. Don't know why? 
- TV narration is different from the actual discourse. 
- Dritrashtra asked Sanjaya about what happened? Not what is happening?
- Hence, Bhagvata Gita is narrated in past tense, after 10 days of war is over. 
- Sanjay tells about warriors on both sides and specifically tells the Kaurva side to protect Bhismapitamaha
- Arjun Says to Krishna, Hey Krishna please take my rath in between the two senas.
- Arjun tells krishna that he's having a panic attack. How can he kill all his family? 
	- To be noted: From a short term perspective Arjuna's fear is not misplaced. Indeed what will he get in the end if every body dies 
	- Which actually happens on both sides. Pandavas loose their sons in the war and Yudhistara is so grief stricken that he doesn't want the empire anymore.
	- Nobody wanted the war in the first place. 
	- Arjuna is just forgetting why the war is happening. 
	- Arjuna says I will abandon the weapons, Dhritrashtra's sons can come and kill me, its better than having the *papa*(sin) of killing family with my own hands. 
	- He then proceeds to sit at the back of *ratha*
	- 
	 At this point the Gita's first Chapter ends with a shloka describing the Bhagavata Gita. 
	 GIta is the source of Brahma Vidya just like Upnishads and is also a Yoga Shastra and as of now till first chapter Krishna hasn't spoken a single word.
