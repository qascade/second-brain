Krishna says that all that you see is coming from Mahata i.e the prakriti tatva and I am the beeja (seed) through which all the creation is happening. 

How does the Purusha connects with the Prakriti? 
It is through this gunas of prakriti - Satva, Rajasa, Tamasa

Then he goes own to explain three gunas: 
- Satva is Nirmala, its very immaculate and through that it has prakasha, it illuminates and it is flawless, and through that it ties the purusha to the prakriti, How? Through Happiness and Knowledge. The experience of satvice happiness, not the joy in someone's unhappiness. The achcha Sukha and Achcha Gyana is coming from satva guna, which is experienced by the atman. 
- Rajasa is Raga-atma, it is coming out of passion/desire.  What is that ties the atma to the body, is karma-sangena (activity), it is that, that makes you very active and wants you to do something, unless you have the desire, no action will happen. 
  - Tamasa is Agyana-ja, it is what arises out of Agyana/ignorance, it leads to delusion/wrong understanding. What is that ties the purusha to the prakriti - Pramadha(Negligence), Alasya (Sloth) and Nidra (Sleep). Basically laziness, not doing things properly, being careless 

When you have Satva, you will be drawn to things that will give you joy, happiness, peace and wisdom. 

When you have Rajasa, it draws to action

When you have Tamasa, it leads you to negligence, it covers your gyana, it covers your gyana so that you cannot use it. 

See all of us have Satva, Rajasa, Tamasa and one is the svabhabik proportion of Satva, Rajasa, Tamasa but it is also not stable, it can change with time, it can change with incidents. 

If one of the Guna dominates, it supresses the other two and accordingly the outcome shows in your action. 

But with write Gyana, we can have the ability to choose the dominant guna or atleast be aware, that at this point it seems like I am getting dominated by one of the Gunas, like maybe I am being deluded, I am not thinking clearly. 

For example, Arjuna during the first chapter is dominated by Rajasa/Tamasa Guna. Did he not know that this war has to be fought? 

The Gunas, will do work on its own, if we don't have control over our indriyas. 
But if we start controlling the mind and the indriyas. We can also manage the dominance of Satva, Rajas, Tamasa Gunas. 

How Do we understand which Guna is active? 
- When we feel like the right Gyana/knowledge is coming to us, when we do actions that are making us feel great, like helping other selflessly, out trying to gain knowledge to have clarity of mind, at that time Satva is more active. 
- Sometimes you see somebodies possession and you get this feeling of jealousy, like I have to get that, sometimes you are angry, sometimes it greed of having something, I desire something so bad, I have to get it no matter what, that makes us act. At this time know that Rajasa is more active. 
- When you feel like your mind and your senses are being deluded, you are completely confused, you are not doing/avoiding the right thing, and you are doing what's not right and then try to even rationalize it. At this time know that the Tamasa is more active. But the problem is that you will rarely even get to notice that Tamas is being more active rn, as it clouds the gyana, your intelligence, you will think what you are doing at that moment is the right thing to do. Until you have the practice of self-awareness/introspection, you are learning to control your indriyas. The world might thing that you are an idiot, but you inside will think that I am doing exactly the right thing. 

At the end of your life, depending upon what is the state of our mind at the point in time the *janma* happens. 
- If you are in very Satvic Bhava, will achieve the lokas where noble people go. 
- If you are in very Rajasic Bhava, still in agitation, He will come back to the samasara-chakra
- If you are in very Tamsic Bhava, They will get the *Moodha-Yoni* (Non-Humanic Yonis) 

Now to be noted, its not possible that the whole life you were in Agyana, now suddenly you have become Gyani. That last moment is gonna be your most true self, Whatever you have been trying all your life, only that will manifest in that moment. 

If you have to make sure that you have a good death, you have to ensure that you live your life accordingly. Try to get more towards the Satvic Bhava. 

- One with Satvic pre-dominance, will be elevated
- One with Rajasic pre-dominance, will remain status quo
- One with Tamsic pre-dominace, will get (Adho-Gati) degraded. 

But at the same time, you are still not free because, the satva has still tied you only, maybe its the best of the other two gunas but it has still jailed you. At this moment the purusha is still thinking that he/she and prakriti are the same, it is just that the bhava is still better. The Moksha will not happen in this state as well. The Moksha will happen only when you realize that the action is not with the purusha, the purusha doesn't identify itself with the prakriti. 

When you get beyond the Satva, Rajasa, Tamasa, that is when you are called *Guna-Titya*. When that happens, then you go beyond the janama-mrityu-jara-dukha. 

Arjuna has a question here? 
`You told me about becoming Guna-Atita? How does one become Guna-Atita? and How do you identify a person who has become Guna-Atita`

Whatever be the situation? 
- He does not hate what he thinks is not good, 
- He doesn't run away from what is not good. 
- He doesn't desire that which is good. 
- He lives because he must live. 
- He does because he must do. 
- He remains detached and is not disturbed by the Gunas, 
- He just accepts that the Gunas will come and do their job, he remains undisturbed. 
- He has equanimous attitude towards sukha-dukha, 
- He is Sama-Darshini. 
- He doesn't care about money, gold. 
- He doesn't care about his likes/dislikes. 
- He has the same attitude towards praise/insults given to him. If he thinks the feedback makes sense, he will take it and work on it, if doesn't make sense he will just ignore it. 
- He will have same attitude towards Friends/Enemies
- He is a Karma-Fala Sanyasi 
- He has un-flinching shradhdha in me (Krishna) 
Such a person will eventually achieve Brahma.
