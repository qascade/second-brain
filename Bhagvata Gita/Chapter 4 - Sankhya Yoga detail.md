Here at the start, Shri Krishna tells arjuna about the history of Gita and how he had already taught this to Vivasvan (seat of suryadeva) -> taught it to Manu -> taught it to King Ikshvaku

Krishna here slowly starts revealing his real form, first he gives hints about being present in the past itself and then he directly says that I have taken birth in this form using my own yoga-maya. I am *ajanma* (unborn) and un-destructible.

[[text4.7]] I only take birth when there is decline in dharma. 
This can also be seen as prkriti having a self-correcting mechanism. 

Although Krishna has taken birth but he is not doing any karma as a personal gain involved. Hence, he is the *akarta*. 

He says that he only created the 4 varnas acc. to the karmas they perform. 

A lot of my disciples/devotees have followed the same sidhaanta in the past and have been liberated from karma-bandhan. You also follow in their footsteps. 

## Dharma 
- Dharma comes from "dhru", which is also the word that starts with "Dharti", Dharma is the anything that sustains and grow life. 
- If you act against dharma by doing adharma, the dharma will eventually destroy you. 
- My understanding till now is that not doing karma is adharma in itself. You do karma that is according to dharma and not get attached to the outcome. You do it as if you are doing it for Krishna. 
- Dharma can be seen as this larger code of conduct/principle that applies to all scopes within life. 
- The scope can be self, family, workplace, nation, world, etc. 
	- In family you can make the scope even more granular like towards your children, father, mother, friends, extended family etc. 
- If you define the above mentioned scopes as a life units. In order for a life unit to sustain, everybody has to act according to their dharma. But when you have so many scopes of dharma, there is bound to be a conflict. That is know as "Dharama-Sankata". At that point you have to decide which scope of dharma takes precedence. 
- Prkriti has three *gunas* acc. to Sankhya-Yoga known as **Satva, Rajas and Tamasa**. 
- We all have the three gunas, no body is free of the three gunas. Given the proportion of the three gunas a person has, I have assigned a Varna to him. 

 Do we have better model of classification than this 4 varnas in the modern world? 

Swadharma is also very similar to the japanese framework of ikigai. 

## Continue 

[[text 4.17]] One must properly understand the difference between *karma*, *akarma* and *vikarma*. 
- One explanation is that the distinctions will come naturally to you after purna-samarpana. 
[[text 4.18]] One who can see *akarma* in *karma* and *karma* in *akarma* is an intelligent person. 
- The one who is doing everything for Krishna is although doing karma but it is akarma, there is no distinction between the two. He has become the perfect karma yogi who is not attached to outcomes. 
[[text 4.19]] The defintion of pandita. 

Tapsya: Need to have a lot of physical and mental definition

[[text 4.33]]Krishna says the best of all the yagnas is Gyan Yagna (Swadhyaya)
[[text 4.34]] to understand sankhya yoga, you have to find people who understand the bhagwat will. You have to worship them, pay obesience to them and they will impart their knowledge onto you. 

Having Shraddha is also important to gain knowledge in life. Even in science, you don't always start from first principles because you believe that already established theories comes from first principles itself. So having shraddha in discourse of Krishna and our Rishi Parampara is essential towards gaining true knowledge towards become a yogi. 

Krishna says that ignorant and faithless persons can't become yogis. 


So, in this chapter Krishna says, 
- doing swadhyaya through gyana yoga is the ultimate yoga of all 
- Find a spiritual guru and become his disciple
- Through gyana, you can learn how to detach yourself from karma fala 
- Have Shraddha, otherwise there's no point in this discourse in itself.
