Here Arjuna asks, which is better KarmaYoga or Karma-Sanyasa(surrendering to Krishna)

[[text 5.2]] Krishna says Karma-Sanyasa is best of the above
The point is theory of how a machine works, makes you better operators of the said machine. Although only learning how to operate the machine won't stop you from using the machine but you may not be able to become the master of it. 

[[text 5.4]] Only fools says that Sankhya is different from Karma Yoga. One who does one of them perfectly will achieve the benefits of both 

One who has got the the *gyana* (wisdom) from sankhya yoga such a *pandita* will see every living being(humans, animals, plants, etc.) in this material world beyond the physical distinctions as same. But that doesn't change how the living being behaves in the material world. A dog cannot be a elephant from material sense. 

[[text 5.14-5.15]] needs more discussion

[[text 5.19]] Those whose minds have become equanimous have already conquered birth and death. They are already situated in Brahman 

[[text 5.23]] A person who before his death is able to tolerate desire/lust and anger, that person is yogi and is happy.

[[text 5.27-28]] A way to meditate (Prabhupada saysa that this is the starting of description of the ashtanga yoga)

Karma Sanyasa - Also means that you are doing something from the best of your abilities without thinking about the consequences. 

# Functioning in the boundaries of Prakriti 
A shishaya gets trampled by a elephant because he sees the atma in him, but he doesn't see the atma in the guy beside him who warned him to run. 

So, even if through gyana yoga you learn that everybody is atma underneath. You still have to function in the boundaries of prakriti.
