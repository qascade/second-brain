Arjuna says now I understand everything that you are situated in everything and everywhere, but Can I see your form where you are creating, sustaining and destroying everything at the same time, Like how everything is coming out of you, and where everything is dissolving back in to you. 

Krishna agrees to show his Universal divine form by granting special sight to Arjuna, as Arjuna's Human eyes are incapable of seeing his real form. Krshna grants him *divya* *chakshu* to see his *yoga-aishwarya*. In short, to experience Krishna's real form behind, you have to move beyond your *indriyas*, the form cannot be experienced, or seen or even explained by humans faculties. 

The previous chapter was all about *Bhagavana* being one in many, in this chapter it's all about *Bhagavana* being many in one.
