We are reading Gita from a third person perspective. That's why we can understand what Arjuna is going through as we don't have any skin in the game, but same is not true for Arjuna, so he may not be able to fully grasp the concept of being a Karma Yogi. 

Even after such a beautiful and elaborate explaination of Karma Yoga, Arjuna says to Shri Krishna: 

[[Text 3.1 and 3.2]]
- Bhai toh agar buddhi pe hi kaam krna hai toh mujhe ladha kyu rahe ho :) 
- App bass aise hi kuch ajeeb si baate krke, mera mann behlane ki baat kr rahe ho. Apne itne type ke yoga bata diya, Ek baat kro na. 

Technically, Chapter 2 is the gist of all of Gita. But the thing is because Arjuna is in such a sorry state, he wants to ensure that he gets it no matter what. That's why Krishna proceeds even further. 

- Sankhya Yogi does Gyana Yoga, Yogis do Karma Yoga 
- You cannot detach yourself from *karma-fala* without performing the *karma* itself .
- If Bhakti is also Karma, than I should also detach myself from thinking about the outcome of Bhakti right?? Is this what means to do Purna Samarpana?  
	- I got my answer - [[Text 3.9]], explaination:  
- Do your work as you worship( Yagna ), The doer is not the center point of yagna here. 
	- What happens during a Yagna?? 
	- There is a *Yajamana*, who wants to do a *Yagna*. 
	- and there is a *Purohit* who will perform the *Yagna*. 
	- Also, just as the purohit isn't doing the Yagna for himself. You do your worship not only for yourself but everyone in this world. 
	- This is what is known as *Seva-Bhava*. 
	- You do *yagna* as a offering to *devatas* and in return the *devatas* give you boons and prosperity. Hence, you both grow and thrive together 
		- Basically you do yagna for others and others will do the yagna for you. Also *Shreyasa* means Progress. 
	- So essentially, the idea is to not be selfish in what you get through others. Its beautiful is come sense that I used to do this all the time. Even during my anxiety days. 
	- When you don't even desire *Moksha*, you can get *Moksha*. 
	- The *Bhava* of Moksha can be achieved now as well. Like however life goes on, you are always in a bliss, not agitated.
	- You have to work in the best of your abilities for something that is way beyond you. By doing, that you will become *Yoga-stha* and get the Bhava of Moksha and feel the *peace*. 
	- Note: Detachment doesnot mean indifference. 
	- One very good explaination by Ami Ji, If you believe in God, do everything as if you are doing it for him and accept the outcome in *prasada*. 
	>[!Observation]
	>>Everything boils down to the *bhava* you have towards the actions you perform and how you participate in life. 

**Bhakti Yoga**: Doing Karma with the Bhagvata will. Its not just only about Puja/Paatha. 
- Bhakti Yoga practically means doing karma with a Purana-Samarpana Bhava
 
  
- It's not like anybody has never achieved this state before. Raja Janaka has done it. **Ashtavakra Gita** is told in Raja Janaka's court. 
- Why it also helps others is because people follow strong leaders. 
- Think about it, Krishna doesn't need to do any work in the three *Lokas* but he is still standing in the battlefield doing his *karma*. 
- You do your own introspection without disclosing it with others, who are busy in material obligations. 
-  [[text 3.35]]: You have your own *guna*, that you are born with, If you run away without doing your prescribed duties, will you be happy?  (Need more introspection?)
	  - Act in a way that is coming naturally to you and that is also your *kartavya*
	  - Even if faulty action, do it, because you better die doing what you are good at and what is natural to you. You will never succeed in that path anyway and you will never be happy. 

Now Arjun asks a very important question: 
- [[text 3.37]] - Why does then someone still commit *papa* despite not wanting it? 
- Krishna answers: Desire and Anger clouds your intellect and compels you to do *papa*(s) that you otherwise, wouldn't even dream of committing. 
- In the end, Krishna says that Indriya < Sense objects < mind < soul. You control your senses using your mind. If you keep desire and anger away from you, you don't need anything else. 
  
**Chapter 3 ends here. Next Chapter is on Bhakti Yoga.**
