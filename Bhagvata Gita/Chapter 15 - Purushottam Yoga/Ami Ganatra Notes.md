In this chapter Krishna, continues the thought of how to become Guna-Atita in previous chapter. 

The (Ashwata Tree) Pipala (Bargada) Tree, the roots of the tree grows downwards towards the ground and later become part of the tree, in turn making the trunk more thicker. 

Krishna gives this imagery of the Ashwata tree and he compares it to the sansara vriksha. 

From the atma tatva (purusha), this ashwata tree of sansara, which has roots and branches, is coming out . The leaves of this tree are *chandan* (Veda Shlokas), Its branches are going out goint down every where, and these branches are being strengthened by the Gunas and the senses are the seeds/buds that will give rise to more Ashwata trees and growth. 

The roots which are going down, those are your karmas, the actions that you are taking for which we are expecting returns, for which you will get the *karma-fala*. They are the ones that will tie you into the karma/karma-fala cycle. 

At one point the tree become so huge, you can't even figure out which root came first, which came last. There's no limit to this tree, there is no beginning, there is no end and it has become very strong. The Gunas and prakriti has made this tree so strong, that we can't even fathom who we are, where we came from, what is atma tatva and stuff. 

There is only way to break out of it. You have to cut it from its root. By using the axe called `Asangha` - detachment. Once you uproot that tree, start focusing on the `Avyaya` tatva/ Purusha tatva. How? 
- By Cutting that tree, 
- and by attitude of *nirmana* and *nirmoha*,
- detachment by not having any ahamkara,
- having control over desires 
- Being very gratified 
- Focus on Adhyatama
- Getting out of dualities of happiness/sorrow 
and eventually such wise people achieve the status which is always eternal/ un-changing/blissful. This status/place/pada, is self-illuminated, you don't need sun to illuminate it. (because sun also has the same source - the diving principle) 

The Purusha tatva is my *ansha* only which is connected with the prakriti tatva and because of that connection to this prakriti, it gets so involved like Air doesn't have odor of its own but when air has dust particles that's when the odor comes out and the *vayu*, it carries the odor. The odor is from prithvi tatva, the vayu is odorless in itself, but for us whether prithvi or vayu is different doesn't matter, we perceive both as the same entity. 

Likewise the individual atma of the beings which is the *ansha* of the param tatva, it carries with it the sanskaras, the Guna dharma of the prakriti that it has connected to even after the death, and because they are still not out of the karma-bandhana, they take birth again those sansaras fruitify. 

Even the seed that is leading to the creation is me. 

Bhojana Mantra: (15.14) -> Even the fire that is needed to digest the food, I am that fire, which then digest the food which is eaten 

Types of foods: 
 - One that is chewed, One that is Swallowed, One that is licked and One that is sucked. To digest this, I am that fire and give you the strength to live 

I am in everyone's heart and I am also the source of this intelligence and I am also the tatva in the vedas that should be known. 

Kshar -> means temporary, Akshar -> means permanent. 

Even beyond the kshar/ akshara tatva, there is the supreme unchanging purushottama tatva and I am that. 

The wise person realized me as that supreme tatva, understands that supreme tatva and constantly focuses on that supreme tatva, He eventually achieves the moksha. 

There is a way larger tatva here (purushottama tatva) -> you should focus on that and practice the purushottam yoga..
