Class 6: 38:43

From here we have finished almost all of the gita's message. 
From now on what's Krishna is going to describe is more of a conceptual/abstract framework. 
- Prakriti, Purusha, Satva, Rajasa, Tamasa

Hey Kaunteya, This body is known as the Kshetra (all that is physical) and the one who knows this body(Kshetra) is known as Kshetragya. 


- Mana, 
- Ahamkara, 
- Buddhi, 
- A-vayaktama (Mool-Prakriti) , 
	- One that is un-manifest. Which is the Moola-Prakriti tatva. 
- 10 Indriyas - (5 Gyana-Indriyas, 5 Karma-Indriyas) and
- Pancha-Indriya-Gochara(Object of senses - Sound, touch, color, taste and smell)
- Pancha-Bhootani,

- So total 24 parts of Kshetra 
- But in Kshetra, you have to understand some other aspects as well like Ichcha, Dvesha, Sukha- Dukha, anything that comes out as interaction with Kshetra, are also parts of Kshetra only. 

Now Krishna tells about Gyana, what is need to become Kshetragya
What are the qualities needed for that? 
- Lack of pride (A- Mana- niya)
- Lack/Absence of Dambha (Hypocricy)
- Non-violent
- Shanti (The ability to accomodate)
- Arjavama (Straight-forwardness)
- Acharya-Upasana (Being devoted to Guru)
- Very Clean (both from body and mind)
 - Dhairayama (Stability)
 - Atma-Vini-graha (Control over self and Mind)
 - Being detached from linkings/dislikings of Indriyas
 - Un-Ahmakara (No ego)
 - Understanding Janma (birth), Mrityu (death), Jara (Old Age), Roga (Disease) are part of life 
 -  Sense of detachment from familial and self belongings 
 - Unflinching Faith (shradhdha) in Bhagwana tatva
 - Being happy living in a Isolating place, where there's no tension, distraction
 - Started to get detached from a lot of people, being self-composed, etc. 
 - Always trying to focus on the Spiritual/Tatva Gyana. 

All of these above written 20 qualities, a wise man will possess them. Anything other than these will be Agyana. 
Through, this Gyana, you will get to know the Gneyama (That which should be known). 

Once having the Gyana, you will know the Para-Brahma which is neither Satta nor Asatta. 

Krishna says that I am everywhere,  I am that Para-Brahamana tatva which is not associated with any Gunas (Nir-Guna), but still experiences the Gunas. Its inside everybody but its also outside. It is in-divisive, it is the creator, sustainer and destroyer of everything. It is the light of the light (that which makes light possible). 

After that Krishna gives more technical details about prakriti. 

Class 6: 1:00:07

Prakriti is what is responsible for action, evolution, changes, anything that you see in action. Prakriti is the operational aspect of the kshetra and Purusha is just *sakshi* which is again the kshetra. (its one on one mapping) 

The Purusha attaches itself to the prakriti and become the experiencer of gunas of the prakriti. Purusha doesn't have a form or rupa, it doesn't have any gunas, but still it experiences because it chooses to attach itself to prakriti. Prakriti is what has these gunas, but prakriti also doesn't have any meaning in itself if you think about it, what is the meaning of experience if there is no experiencer (observer). Hence, the combination of purusha and prakriti is what life is and that's what Krishna is asking us to understand. 

If this attachment of purusha and prakriti hadn't happened. Nothing would have happened, Atman would be Atman, prakriti would be prakriti, but this attachment has happened because of which you see the world go on in its field of activities. We consider the purusha and prakriti as one but they are not the same. 

So, what action is happening is the prakriti tatva and what we are is the purusha tatva. 

and this Purusha in all of us is basically the parmatma and the one who knows/understands this i.e the action happens because of the prakriti but the purusha tatva is what we are i.e the paramatma tatva -> he gets moksha 
But understands not just theoretically but one who realizes this will be the one who will become Guna-Atita , Yoga-astha, Sthita-pragya, but for that realization to happen, first you need to have gyana. 

```
Side Note: 

In Santana Dharma, there are six Darshanas (to see)
but to see what ? Ultimate Reality 
In what way? the connection of this atma to the parmatma
1. Purva-Mimamsa
2. Uttra-Mimamsa/Vedant -> Advait, Dvait, etc. 
3. Samkhya (Purusha Tatva/Prakriti Tatva) -> Its the darshana that talks explicitly about relation between purusha and prakriti tatva, it doesn't directly says that Purusha is parmatma tatva, its the vedant that says that both Purusha and Parmatma comes from the same parmatma tatva (one is a higher form other is the lower one) (25 tatvas)
4. Yoga -> How do you reach to the realization of that connection of atman tatva to the parmatman tatva is what is essentially yoga. 
5. Vaisheshikha -> (Google it.) (Physics kind of stuff (anu))
6. Nyaya -> How should arguments happen? How should you debate? How through intellectual discussions, you achieve that state of moksha. 
```

How do people understand this purusha tatva? 
 - Through Dhyana
 - Through Karma 
 - Through Sanyasa 
 -  etc.. 
But the goal is to realize that we are the prakriti and how prakriti behaves the way it does? and How all the dualities we see are manifestation of this prakriti. 

This Purusha tatva is equal in everybody. The Karta is the prakriti, the purusha is the A-karta. 

Hey Arjuna, like the one sun illuminates the whole world, it takes the kshetri(one who lives in the kshetra) that illuminates the world. So, the prakriti which has gunas, gets into motion because of the atma, 

What is Agyana? It is thinking that purusha and prakriti are one and the same? 

What is Gyana? It is realizing that purusha and prakriti are not the same, hence, the doer is the prakriti not us, the karta is the prakriti not us. 

```Personal Question? 
If the doer is the prakriti and purusha is akarta, 
Then who is operating the prakriti? If its in self motion? What about free-will? Maybe one way to think about is that Purusha karta hoke bhi akarta hai.
