Arjuna asks another question on this chapter? 
He wants to understand more about tyaga and sanyasa. 

Krishna Says: 
Different people have different views on it. 
- Some wise people say actions done for material pleasures or individual desires, only for that sake, we should give those up. 
- Some people say do whatever you are doing, but you should do the karma-fala tyaga, don't try to own or control the outcome
- Some people say that every action has some or the other *dosha* (defect/shortcomings), So give up everything. 
- Some people say give up everything, but tapa, gyana and yagna shouldn't be given up 

Krishna tells his opinion: 
Yagna, Dana, Tapa should never be given up. Why? because these purify your chitta. 
These actions shouldn't be given up, your kartavya shouldn't be given up, but how should you do them, by giving up intense attachment to anything and the outcome of it and this is satvic. You don't hate something if it is going to require some effort to do it, because it is your kartavya, but you don't like it. 

If you give up karma, even your kartavaya, even your niyata-karama, a person who gives up his kartavya due to moha, This is tamsic. 

Giving up something because it is difficult, because you will have physical/mental pain, This is Rajasic. 

In actions where you couldn't do complete complete tyaga, you can have following outcomes 
 - What you desired 
 - What you didn't desire 
 - or mixture of both 

Even in situations where you got what you desired, have a gratittude that whatever I got and just say that whatever I got is because of god's grace.

```
In general, even if you have a desire of a certain outcome. You just have a perception of it, that maybe that's what is best of you. But you really won't know until you wait for the future. 
```

Any impulse to work, there are two parts to it - 

- Gneyama - Something that is to be known in the future, like a system design course. 
- Sankalpa - Commitment to get it done 

Even in this situation you can divide the work into three Gunas, 
the desirous object in itself doesn't have any guna, so let's just keep that aside- 
- Karta/Pari-gyata is of three types 
- Gyana - is of three types 
- Karma that you do is also of three types 

That ultimate knowledge that the underlying unit of everything - While externally all the things look different, it is that brahma tatva which is into everybody, which is undivisible. That one who is in many and the many who is one. 
One who really realizes that is called as Satvic Gyana 

The Gyana in which you see everything is different, something is good, something is bad, those kinds of divisions which a person sees without really taking the parma tatva behind it into consideration, which is mainly all of us, is Rajsic. To operate in this world, you need Rajasic Gyana. 

The Gyana in which you have mad kind of obsession over that one idea, my way or high way, this is the only truth, or the only thing to do without having any rationale, or basis or truth. This is the only truth or this is the only idea. That is called tamsic. (Extremity)

`Bhishma Pitamaha was not Tamsic.???  `

What kind of Karma will be Satvic: 
 - Prescribed by Shastras 
 - Done without pasion/anger
 - While being akarta and tyaga 
What is Rajasic karma: 
- Exactly opp of satvic 
- Done with desire of material something 
- Done with passion

What is Tamsic karma: 
- Without thinking, without even having thought about the outcome. 
- Completely out of ignorance, moha
- Saying random humiliating things to people

Rajasic is by enlarge what is needed to operate in this world. The idea is while being in Rajas, Trying to avoid Tamas as much as possible can we try to move towards Satvic, as much as possible and even beyond that. 

There is a very thin line between Self-Respect and Ahamkara, can only be understood with experience. Even Arjuna couldn't leap to become yoga-stha even after directly getting gita-updesha from bhagvana, on the 9th day Krishna had to threaten Arjuna into attacking Bhishma Pitamaha. 
But we should take this discourse and text as awareess and take small small steps towards Satvic and then beyond that. 

What will be the Satvic Karta: 
- Detached but not indifferent
- No sense of "I" or mera mera
- With Excitement, Dhriti - Perseverance/Firmness, With large heart, He cares for everyone

What will be Rajsic Karta: 
- You will try to do anything to get what you want 
- The outcome will affect you mentally you - either extremely happy or very upset

What will be Tamsic Karta: 
- No sense or control 
- Absolute indulgence to physical pleasures, no control over mind 
- No Samskaras 
- Stupid and Eccentric - in a negative way
- Shattha - Deceptive
- Procrastinator (Dirgha-Sutri)
- But still have a lot of conviction, because they still think that whatever they are doing is the right thing to do. 

There are two more Krishna speaks about: 
Why is a person behaving the way he should? 
Because of his intellect (Buddhi)

So Buddhi is also of three types: 

- Vivek Buddhi - What's right, What's wrong, What's good, What's bad, What should be continued, What should be stopped -- that faculty that let's you differentiate, which understand what's moksha, and what activities are going to bind you to samsara-chakra. This kind of buddhi is Satvic buddhi 
- Rajsic Buddhi - When there's not exact clarity of anything above --  Dharama Sankatas. 
- Tamsic Buddhi - One who thinks Dharama is Adharma, ulti buddhi. 
```
There are only two people in Mahabharata who have no confusions/ Dharama Sankatas whatsover, One is Krishna, Other is Duryodhana. 
Duryodhana has no confusion, he thinks whatever he's doing is exactly the right thing to do. 
```
Dhriti  (Resolve/Perseverance of doing anything) is also of three types: 
- Satvic Dhriti: The Resolve to control your manasa indriya, that is the satvic perseverance. 
- Rajsic Dhriti: The Resolve for any goal for material pleasure.
- Tamsic Dhriti: The Resolve to not give up things that should be given up like alasya, ir-rational fear, mada, all kind of addictions. 

Sukha is also of three types: 
- Satvic Sukha: The sukha that you get out of abhyasa of controlling your mind. 
- Rajsic Sukha: The sukha that you get immediately. Long Run you are gonna suffer. 
- Tamsic Sukha: The kind of sukha that makes you *manda*. Like you take drugs, alcohol. 
There is nothing in this world that doesn't have the three gunas - The only thing we can do is to try to move more and more towards the Satva and eventually get to a position where you are not troubled by the activity of the gunas. 

Based on these Gunas, Krishna has created the Chatur-Varnas (4 Varnas). 

Whatever is the profession you do, if you do it well, you will achieve that bliss (Siddhi) 

Krishna says to Arjuna: 
If now out of ahamkara, because you are thinking that you can determine everything and you can decide your wins and losses. You think you started this war, but this is not the case and saying that you will not fight this war, is also out of ahamkara. 

I have told you everything, think about this thorougly, and do as you wish. 

You are very dear to me, Come to me, surrender to me, put your bhava in me, worship me, Don't think about anything else. Think of it as its my karya. 

Then Krishna says something little different: 
This Shastra which we have discussed right now, you should not tell this to anyone who doesn't have shraddha, who has no discipline, who is very jealous. 
```
Why he's saying that? 
A lot of people today say, that this granth is a grantha of war. Krishna is blood-thirsty, who is trying to create peace, telling him to fight and he got everybody killed. People who have very vile intentions would never be able to understand real essence of this granth. Only when someone has shraddha, has discipline and openness to understand, they will be able to understand this grantha. 
```

Anybody who studies this is very dear to me, Anybody who talks about this is very dear to me and one who studies this - it is like worshipping me itself. Even if you have not read it, you are only hearing this with Shraddha, that is also acceptable to me. 

and then he asks Arjuna: 
Have you heard everything with a focused mind? Has your delusion/Agyana gone away? 

Arjuna Says: 
Yes, my moha has gone, my memory has come back, thanks to you and with your blessings, I am very firm now with now Sandeha (doubt). I will do what you told me to do, (with his own volition) . 

Sanjaya Uvacha: 
I heard this Adbhut Samvada of Krishna and Arjuna and I am having Goosebumps, Thanks to vyasa ji , I could see and hear this. Yogeshwar Krishna himself spoke and I could see and hear thanks to my divya chakshu, and I keep remembering and thinking about it again and again. I am excilerated, happy and remembering this. I saw this beautiful form of Bhagwana Hari , I was in vismaya(awe-struck) and I am remembering that and again and again I am becoming happy

After this Sanjaya says the last Shloka: 
This is what I am understanding, where-ever there is Krishna and Arjuna, there is definitely going to victory and prosperity. 

MERI PYARI DULARI KISHORI JU KI JAI !!
JAI SHREE KRISHNA!!
