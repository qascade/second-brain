Arjuna ask out of Nirakara Upasana and Saakara Upasana, which one is better? 
Krishna says both are valid paths but one is tougher than the other. 

All of us who identify with our bodies, it is very difficult to worship the *nirakara* and *nirguna*, something that is formless. 

The focus here should be the goal, rather than the path, whichever works best for you. But now if you get into fight of what's the best path instead of just focusing on the goal, then Krishna says, you are a lost cause. 

You should not fight/argue about paths to attain god as the shraddha that comes, takes birth inside is also a *kripa* from the divine. 

All the names like Shiva/Vishnu/Krishna are just at sansarik level to make us reach and understand that divine tatva better, under the hood all the names are the names of the same divine tatva that creates, governs, upholds, sustains and destroys everything. 

Ultimately, what matters is the *bhava* that you have while you worship me. Then, Krishna goes on to say what are the different approaches that a person should think about. 

Ways to attain me: 

- No matter what you do, your *bhava*, your *buddhi* and your *mind* should always be completely focused in me (bhagvada tatva). But he also knows that its not possible, because we have our responsibilities to perform in life, there is another way to do this: 
- But if you can't do this all the time, just practice, do dhayana yoga, but if you can't even do that?
  (There are certain situations in life, where a person may be going through a tragedy, he/she is so full of negativity baggage, that sitting in dhayana/meditative state works against them, so you don't tell them to meditate, you may give them alternatives like naama japa or read something, because you don't know what their mind is going to throw up and the person may not be that mentally strong at that point to accept that)
- (Text 12.10) Then whatever Karma you do, do it with a *bhava* that you doing it for me. There are different interpretations for this shloka, some also interpret it as doing nama japa and reminiscing the past-times, or do seva or satsanga. Now if this is not possible, as this may also require a level of dedication/devotion, Krishna also understands that: 
- Then, do whatever you do as you do, just do one thing, stop thinking about the consequences of your actions, don't try to own the consequences for your actions. (Let go of them) and leave the *Karma-fala*. Hence, coming back to what he said to chapter 2, 3, 4. 
- Karma-Fala Tyaga > Dhayana > Gyana > Abhyasa
- Logically if you think about it, you need to understand, have certain amount of gyana, dhyana and abhyasa to do Karma-fala tyaga. 
- Once, you achieve that constant habit of *karma-fala tyaga*. There will be a lot of peace in mind. 
- After this Krishna describes the qualities of his bhaktas, they are equanimous in all dualities, they don't become jealous, etc.. 

This is the end of 12th Chapter here. Here all the key message of Gita has been conveyed, after this Krishna just keeps repeating the same topics again and again in later chapters. From here on: Krishna is going to tell us more of a conceptual framework.
