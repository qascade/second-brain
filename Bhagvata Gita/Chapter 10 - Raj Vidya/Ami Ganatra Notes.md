Krishna explains to Arjuna, who he really is. 

Bhavana is everywhere, the Bhagvada tatva is everywhere, you just have to keep your eyes open. 

He's what is the most excellent thing in every aspect. 

He is the best thing in every thing and in the worst he's gambling. 
He's our mind, He's Indra amongs devatas, He's Maricha among Maruts, He's Vishnu among Adityas, He's Kamadhenu among cows, He's Bhrigu amongst Maharishis, He's Rama amongs warriors, He's Dhananjaya amongst Kurus... etc. etc. He's the desire for every dream, He's the lust for pro-creation, He's the *danda*(power) amongst politicians.
