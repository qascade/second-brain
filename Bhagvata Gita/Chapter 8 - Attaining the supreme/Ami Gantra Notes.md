## Chapter 8 summary
- Krishna says that all the time keep thinking about me. 
- At the end of your life, whatever the person thinks about the person achieves that.
- Hence, always think about Krishna. 
- But to make sure that even in your last moments you are thinking about Krishna, it won't just suddenly come, that will only come if you have mentally practiced that all your life.
