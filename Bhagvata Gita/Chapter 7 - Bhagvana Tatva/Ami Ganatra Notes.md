- Krishna is telling Arjuna to do *Karma Fala Tyaga* by become *yoga-stha* and by becoming *yoga-yukta*. 
- How to become *Yukta*?? 
	- Controlling your mind, controlling your Indriyas, and have control over Kama, Krodha, Lobh, Moh, Mada, Matsarya 
	- Its all about *Mana* (Mind). 
	- You are your own friend and you are your own enemy. 
	- You start by doing some dhyana, yoga anushthana practice. 
	- Develop the perspective that it is all the divine, and you have only limited control over all this. 
- Arjuna says that mind is very *Chachala* and stubborn, Krishna says yes you are right, but its not impossible to control it. 
- Only way is to practice, practice and practice, 
- Once, you become yukta, it shows up in your life. 
- Everything is balanced in their life, from how they sleep, to what they eat and how they behave. 

You have to keep doing your karma, you don't know whats good or bad, or profitable or loss ridden, you have to move beyond all these dualities in life. Remember the Chinese farmer story. Don't give up your effort. 


Also, Krishna has slowly started introducing the idea of "focusing on him". Why does he do that? 

Second line, of [[Text 7.11]] is very important. 
Krishna is saying that he's also desire (*Kama*). Nothing in life is without desire. It begins with Kama and everything then happens from there. But what kind of *Kama* does Krishna constitutes of?? That *kama* should be *Dharma-avirudha*, it should accordance of *dharma*. It should be something that forwards the cause of *dharma*. 

If you want to forward the nation, that desire is worth having, if you want to help others, that desire is worth having.

Krishna is not a part of the three *gunas* - Rajas, Tamas, Satva but it is coming from me. 
Continue from Chapter 4 - 26:40

Krishna is trying to establish himself something larger than life, some one who Arjuna can surrender to and rely on. 

Krishna says don't worry I come in my *sharana* and I will remove all your *papas*. He's saying mentally surrender to me, don't stop obeying and fulfulling your day to day responsibilities. 
Surrender your doubts, fears, stress to me. 

Four types of people try to seek Krishna: One who wants to part away from suffering, one who wants material benefits, one who's curious and the *gyani* who completely understands me. 
Krishna loves all of them but out of the four he loves the *gyani* the most. 

Gyani is one who is happy with whatever Krishna gives, he accepts anything that comes his way as his *prasad* by offering his *karma* to me. 

Any *Shraddha* that a devotee gets to any devata, only Krishna fixes it inside them, but the *fala* of that will only be limited to the material gains and will be temporary, Saraswati will give you Knowledge, Laxmi will give you *Artha* etc. 

However the one who worships me, me here means *Brahmana* (Bhagvana Tatva) - that overarching presence that is making everything happen, which in itself is formless, which in itself is *akarta*, although its *acting* - with the intention of to achieve *sachidananda*/indiriya-vigraha/yoga-stha/bliss/bhagvada-prapti- become free of all kind of *dvandhvas* - *sukha*, *dukha* , *kama*, *lobha*, *moha*, *mada*, *matsarya* - whatever life throws at him accepts it as my *prasada* and live his life as a *yagna* - does his actions/work as a *yagna-sankalpa* (surrendering the karma-fala itself) - that kind of person will eventually become one with me.
