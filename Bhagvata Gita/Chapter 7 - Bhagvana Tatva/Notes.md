Starts with **Shri Bhagwana Uvacha**: 
When you put your mind in me, being a yogi and practicing yoga, you can know me without doubt. 
I will grant you this knowledge of *Tatva* after that nothing else will be left for you to known in this world. 

Out of thousand of Humans, only some put efforts to understand me, and only few of those yogi are capable of understanding what I truly am.

Prakriti is divided into 8 parts: 
- The Panch Maha Bhutas: 
	- Prithvi
	- Jala 
	- Vayu
	- Aakasha
	- Mana 
- Buddhi 
- Ahamkara
But besides these, there is another energy of mine which constitutes this entire creation, try to understand that. 

These two energies are the only two energies - Purusha and Prakriti that constitutes this entire world. Both material and spiritual world I am the only one who is its creator and destroyer. 

As pearls are stuck on a thread, there is nothing in this world that doesnot rest upon me. 

[[Text 7.8 - 7.9]]: I am the taste in water, the light in sun and moon, **the Onkar in Veda**, The sound in the sky and the ability in the man. 
I am the original fragrance of earth, the *teja* of *agni*, the life force in all living organisms and the *tapa* of *tapasvis*.

Because of the three *gunas* - Sattoguna, Rajoguna, Tamas, the world does not know me, that I am above all this. 

Those who constantly do *bhajan* of me, leaves the shackle of this very powerful maya and they can easily cross beyond this world. 

[[Text 7.18]] - There are 4 types of people who try to understand me 
1. Artharthi - one who is doing it for material desires and possesions
2. Aart - one who wants to move away from sorrow and setbacks 
3. Jigyasu - The one who wants to understand me 
4. Gyani - The one who truly understands me. 

Everybody are magnanimous, but the *gyani* is the best and most dear to me. 

[[Text 7.19]]: The one who after many births and deaths attains the knowledge of the real *tatva* and meditates upon me who is the cause of all, is a **Mahatama**. 

If you meditate upon devatas, I will make your meditation rigid towards those devatas, all the fruits you will obtain through that devata only, and ultimately you will go to that devata, but those who meditate upon me will come to me only.
