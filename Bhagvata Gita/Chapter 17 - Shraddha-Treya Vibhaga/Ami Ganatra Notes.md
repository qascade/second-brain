This chapter starts with Arjuna having a question. 
Till now you were saying to have shradhdha on me, but now you are saying do what shastras tell you. Now, its possible that there are people who may not do yagna in-accordance to what scriptures prescribe, may be they don't even know, maybe its not accessible to anybody, it may not work in certain conditions. So, it is possible that people may not be able to follow the shastras to the perfection. But whatever they do, they are doing it for shradhdha.
```
It may become obselete with time, people of different yuga may not understand the context in which it was written, etc. etc. 
```

Krishna doesn't give a direct response to this question, because he can't directly say that its ok to neglect shastras and its also not as if shradhddha and Shastras don't have a link, but its also not as if they are synonymous. There is space for shradhdha even beyond what shastras describe and its correct to assume that person may not know the shastras but the intention is very satvic. 

Krishna's Response: 
Shradhda itself can be Satvic, Rajsic and Tamsic. The essence of a Purusha is reflected in its shradhdha. Actually, its shradhdha also determines how actually the person is. 

He's basically asking us to ponder us more about shradhdha? 
Shraddha is what you are!! 
How you operate in the world over all is all determined by your shraddha. Your attitude to living. Your perception of the world, the interactions, all of this is determined by Shraddha. 

Sharaddha has direct correlation with how you live your life. 
Faith doesn't necessarily has to be on God, its a bit of a universal thing which can be applied to other things as well. For example, if an Asuri Person says that he doesn't believe in God. He has Shraddha towards the belief that god doesn't exist. They will operate in a certain way in this world 

If you genuinely believe that there is a bhagvada tatva and you have deep shraddha on that bhagvada tatva, saying that come what may I leave everything to that bhagvada tatva and behave only as a *nimitta*. 
If this is the kind of shraddha I have, I will operate in the world in way, which Krisna calls as Yoga-stha, Sthit-pragya. 

So, its our sharaddha, that develops our perception. 

But it doesn't mean that you act like fools saying that I have complete shraddha in god, he will deal with it, you should also have some vivek-buddhi. 

Its the Shraddha, that determines our attitude towards any action we take. 

Krishna in one shloka, talks about Shraddha from a Puja perspective: 
Those who worship demi-gods, they are very Satvic. 
There are some who worship Yakshas and Rakshasa, they are very Rajasic.
(Yakshas give you material pleasures)
There are some who do black magic, they are very Tamsic in nature. 

Then Krishna talks about Asuri Tapa: 
Some people who very *ghora* tapasya (very aggressive) (torturing the self) which is not even prescribed in the shastras, full of *dambha* , and with a lot of *ahamkara*, with a lot of *kama*, *raga*  or for vengeance, essentially ignoring the atma tatva, This is *Asuri Tapasya*

Then he goes on to talk about different aspects of personality, life and our activity which all fall into Satvic, Rajsic and Tamsic. Interestingly, he starts with food. 

Satvic Food is one which promotes longetivity, intelligence, mental strength, good for your health, makes you energetic, very stabilizing. 
But don't eat satvic too much, eating too much even for satvic food is unhealthy. 

Rajasic Food is one which is very spicy, very hot and it leads to grief and sickness and acidity

Tamsic food is one which is uncooked, very smelly, very old, stale food, rotting and is very polluted. 

Then he talks about the ritualistic yagna: 
- The Yagna which is done without expecting any returns is satvic. 
- The Yagna which is done with expecting material pleasures for the self or done to show off, is Rajasic 
- The Yagna which is done without any shraddha and you are bargaining dakshina of pujari, no prasad, no food, no offering, is Tamsic 

Sharirik Tapa is discipline you commit to follow a certain discipline. Respecting Gurus, Elders, wise by listening to them, obeying them and taking care of them. 

Maintaining cleaniless in mind, body and sorroundings, living brahmacharya, discipline in your interactions, even in your grihasta life, ahimsa(physical, mind, and speech) 

Vaangmaya/Vachik Tapa(Discipline of speech) is to speak words that will not agitate others, which are not troubling others, which don't hurt others. 

Mansik Tapa is being happy, being mild, preferring silence, having control over your indriyas, having cleanliness, having a good bhaava towards all, not having matsarya and dvesh towards anybody. 

These three tapas done with Sharddha towards the parama tatva without any personal gains involved, without any deep dying desire, such discipline done because it must be done. Such a discipline is Satvic. 

Any action done for Satkara, Maana, Pujaa, Artha i.e people should give me respect, I should show off what I have, To gain more money is called Rajasic Tapa.

Any Action done out of stubborness without caring about its consequences. An action in which I am doing self-harm, or to harm others is Tamsic.

Even Dana is of three types: 
- Satvic Dana is given as a kartavaya to the one who deserves it (at right time and place), not as a favour and not as a return of a favour. 
- Rajasic Dana is which is given as a favour or as a return of a favour, or very grudgingly given, like you don't want to give it but you have to.
- Tamsic Dana is which is given with a very negative bhava, or you are giving it to somebody who doesn't deserve it and given at a wrong time. 

Vidura-Neeti says Dana when not given to deserving and given to undeserving, in both cases, you dana is a waste.

Random Trivia - 
Although, you will never see any date for Gita Jayanti in mahabharata, but all agree that it was never on Ekadashi. But over time every body decided to celeberate Gita Jayanti on Ekadashi.
