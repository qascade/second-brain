In all discourses of dharma, VidhurNiti, ShantiParva, VyadhaGita, discussion between yudhistar and krishna, this one thing comes up again and again 

# What is the most important thing a leader should do? 

Every body be it Krishna, BhishmaPitamaha or anyone else, they all say become `Indriya-Nigraha`, Control your *Indriyas*. If this is achieved most of our problems in life will be solved.
This is the only way, no self-help book, no psychiatrist, no psychologist can help. We have to understand that the only ultimate solution is to control our mind and achieve `Indriya-Nigraha`. 


# Being `Yukta` - doing everything with a balancing act. 

Whatever you do in life - let it be appropriate, balanced. Eat in moderation, eat appropriate to your needs. Not too much, no too little. Do physical activities, travel, recreate. Enjoy yourself, that also in moderation, not too much and not too less. 

One you become `yukta`, yoga will become the solution that will take away your sorrow. 

Our mind and brain is very very smart, it will give justifications for every action you take, so you have to take it under your control 

# Yoga-Anushthana
Krishna says start learning to meditate. Start practicing bringing that one-pointedness in your practice, in your concentration and focus. Once, you get into this dhayana mode, what happens is that you enter into *Parasympathetic Mode*. In this mode, you are able to control your impulses, reactions much better than before. 

Through yoga-anushthana -> you are pushing your body to be more in the para-sympathetic mode. The effect stays after the practice. As your practice keeps on improving that *dhyana* will become part of your life. You will start doing it in every action in your life. 


# Mind is very difficult to control what to do? 
**Krisna says**: 
You have to practice *yoga* dilligently and you have to detach yourself to the process of *yoga* itself. Well, do it and let the effect come. Don't go mad over it. 

For example, somebody has started exercising and everyday they check their weight. Everybody has a different physique, you don't when your weight is going to go down, it may even plateau. You have to keep doing what you are doing. But you get so attached to the process of loosing weight, you will be like I am tired now. I don't care, nothing is gonna happen to my weight. 

You have to keep trying, you should not give up but you should still have a sense of *vairagya*. It will happen eventually, I am not gonna obsess about it. 

You have to see *yoga* as a life long *yagna* that you have to keep doing. But for a person who has never tried to discipline his mind, for them it is very difficult to achieve. 

### A lesson in parenting: 
You have to help your child taming his mind as early in life. You should not keep indulging into whatever wishes they have. A parents job is to teach their children:
- how to think? Not What to think. 
- How to be in control when things don't go your way?
- How to start discipling yourself at each stage? 
It would become a very big problem for a child if doesn't learn to hear a NO!!

The moment you let your amygdyla take over you and get very emotional when things don't go your way, Anger comes, buddhi Nash is inevitable. 


# What happens if I don't become yogi and die? 
- Arjuna asks what happens if I try - try - try to become a yogi, keep failing and die? 
- Will this effort be a complete waste? 
- You keep trying to discipline yourself and avoid all the fun your friends are having and ultimately, you don't achieve the goal you wanted. What then? 
- All that bliss (*Sachidananda*), *Yoga-stha* stuff, nothing is coming :(
	- What to do? 
**Krishna Says**: 
No effort in this marga of yoga goes waste. Here again, Karma-Sidhanta has to be tied to *punara-janama*

Next time you are born again, you will be born in an environment, in an family which are conducive to your spiritual growth. And ofcourse maybe you reading me is a sign of you having that environment, even a tiny nudge towards your growth. 

There will always be an element of free-will along with *purva-sanskaras* and conducive environment. But there will always be a push and inclination. 

Even in *patanjali yoga sutra*, Patanjali gives a way on how to achieve success in the path of yoga? 
- For most people it is through effort (*abhyasa*)
- For some, they are just born with it. 

Krishna then goes on and says that one should sacrifice the *karma-fala* to him and also meditate upon him(the ultimate *tatva*).  Who ever does that he likes them a lot.
