## Shri Bhagwana Uvacha

The person is a *Sanyasi* and *Yogi* iff he detaches himself from the outcomes of his actions done acc. to dharma. 

*Sanyasa* and *Yoga* are one and same because the person who doesnot detach himself from commitments (does fulfillment of commitments imply s) cannot be a Yogi as well. 

**Text 6.3**: Needs more explanation. 

A person has become *yoga-roodha* or elevated in yoga who doesn't act on sense gratification and who has renounced his material commitments and also detached himself from the attachment of outcome from his actions. 

One has to achieve such a state himself using mind as its tool. Mind is a friend as well as an enemy of a person trying to become a yogi. 

**Text 6.6**: For a person who has conquered the mind, mind is his greatest friend, and for others who have failed to do so, it is their greatest enemy of the person. 

Hot and Cold, Joy and Pain, Praise and Insult, if a person in any of these situations is equanimous, there is only parmatma in his wisdom.

**Text 6.8**: A person who satisfied with the *gyana*, who looks at stones, silver, gold as same, who has control over his senses. Such a person has already attained *Bhagavata Prapti*.

**Text 6.9**: A person is great if, he treats well wishers, affectionate benefactors, neutral mediators, envious, friends and enemies **all the same**. 

**Text 6.10**: A yogi (in a secluded quite place) should always engage his body, should carefully control his mind and always true be one with *parmatma* 

**Text 6.11-6.12**: How do yoga? Use Kusha Grass, Deer Skin and cloth to make a aasan that is not too high but also not too low. Sit on it and try to control the mind by fixing it in one point. 

**Text 6.13-6.14**: Straighten your back neck and head in one line. Stare steadily at the tip of your nose. Throw away fear, horniness, distractions, should meditate upon krishna and with him being his ultimate goal. 

**Text 6.16**: A person cannot become a yogi if he eats too much or too little, or if he sleeps too much or too little. 

**Text 6.17** : One has to regulate his sleep, eating, recreation and work in order to attain the fruits of following a yoga system. 

**Text 6.18**: You are situated in yoga, if you have completely controlled your mind and removed all material desires. 

**Text 6.19**: Just like a lamp does not waver in windless room, the yogi's mind doesnot waver in the state of *dhyana*

**Text 6.20-6.29**: Yogi should keep practicing the wandering mind and put it back to one pointedness and keeping dhyana in parmatma. Once that is done, the yogi gets *sukha* that he has experienced never before. He starts seeing himself in every one and everyone in himself. No pain/sorrow can touch him. 

**Text 6.30**: If start seeing Krishna in everyone. Krishna will also see you. 
## Arjuna Uvacha
**Text 6.33-6.34**: Arjuna says the method of yoga you are describing is very impractical as mind is very powerful and its very difficult to control it, as if you are trying to stop winds with your hands.

## Shri Bhagwana Uvacha

**Text 6.35-6.36**: Shri Bhagwan says that I admit that mind is difficult to control, but if you keep practicing properly, imo, its achievable. 

## Arjuna Uvacha
**Text 6.37-6.39**: What happens to person who starts practicing yoga and then leaves in between? 
What happens to the person who keeps switching b/w worldly affairs and yoga? Will he reach no where? 

**Text 6.46**: A yogi is greater than a ascetic, an empiricist, and a fruitive worker (A person who attaches himself to outcomes )

**Text 6.47**: The yogi who does bhajan of Krishna, is the greatest of all, in his(Krishna) opinion.
