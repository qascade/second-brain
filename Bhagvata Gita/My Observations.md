- Karma fala tyaga is one thing, but sacrificing myself to Krishna is the most difficult sacrifice I have ever encountered. 
- Is it even possible to sacrifice my whole self to Krishna. 

## Food for thoughts?
- Does just renunciation of outcomes, implies that I have sacrificed my ego to Krishna? 
- Does fulfillment of commitments implies that I am indulging in sense gratification?
