Here Krishna sounds like that he has only give half of the knowledge *Atman* till now. 
It sounds to me that Arjuna might take a bad decision based on half knowledge. Maybe it's my thought as well as I was also once of the camp "What's the point of existence in the world" after reading this description. 

But if I read **Shrila Prabhpada's translation.** 

```
Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of Prtha, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works
```

- But here it sounds positive, the translation of the tone here seems like wait for the rest of the knowledge to come and you will actually leave the bondage of karma. 
- Analytical Study is for the word *Sankhya*, which acc. to Nirukti or Vedic Dictionary means describing things in detail and Sankhya refers to the philosophy which describes the soul in detail and *yoga* involves controlling the senses.
