Krishna said that what I have described until now is Sankya or Buddhi Yoga, now I will tell you from the perspective of Karma Yoga. 

- If you follow your life according to the principles of *Karma Yoga*, you will become the person with unwavering focus and sheer will. (Basically John Wick) 
- So Krishna roasted the whole point of abrahmic religion in one shloka [^1]
- Vedas talks about three *Gunas* or modes of material nature. In [[Text 45]], Krishna wants Arjuna to transcend these three modes. To be free from all dualities and from all anxieties of gain and safety, and be established in the *atmavan* or self. 
- All the purposes, of Verdas can be served to one who know the purpose behind them 
- The Famous [[Text 47]]: (The fundamental principle of Karma Yoga)
	- You have right over your actions
	- You donot have right over the outcome of the said actions
	- Do not do action only because of outcome.
	- Also, do not get attached to *inaction*. Like someone might say if I don't work for the outcome, why should I even work? Explanation for this comes in Chapter 3. 
- [[Text 48]] (The definition of *yoga*): 
	- By becoming *Yoga-stha*, success and failures become equanimous. 
	- *Yoga* is when your mind is in equanimity with respect to both success and failure. 
	- Translation in Gita As it Is
```
Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure (siddhi or asiddhi*). Such equanimity is called *yoga*. 
```
  
- [[Text 50]]
	- *Yoga* is also putting your best in the action. 
	- Just because you don't have right over the outcomes, doesn't mean you do a shoddy job, still strive for excellence.
	- If you are unbothered by the success and failure of your actions, *yoga* is also what helps you achieve **excellence in anything that you do.**
Basically Krishna is telling Arjuna, 
`Yoga is what that you must do, as it is what is expected of you` . Because only then he can proceed with the war without caring about the actions he is gonna take during the battle i.e killing his own family.

- If you achieve that mindset of equanimity, i.e you will give your best to any action what come may, you will achieve the state of *sthita-pragya* (wisdom). 
If you abondon the moh for action's fruit and just do karma yoga, you will become one with *Parma-atma*

 **We should read shloka 62-63 everyday**
Text 62: 
- While contemplating object of senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust(desire) develops, and from lust anger arises. 
- When you are focused on something, you get so attached to it that now you want it come what may. That attachment leads to intense desire, which on fulfilment will become to intense anger.  
Text 63: 
- From anger -> delusion -> bewilderment -> intelligence lost -> you again get lost in material world 
- When I am angry I will forget the potential outcome of my action, when my intelligence is lost due to anger. 

Text 70:
- The feelings and emotions will be there with you always, don't let your mind impacted by it. 

All of the topics being talked here are very physiological in nature. 
The parasympathetic system(stress hormones), also known as Mana,  shouldn't be kicked off in the first place. They happen because of your attachment with outcome. If you control your Mana or mind with your intellect or Buddhi, that should be the first step towards becoming a Karma Yogi. 

Yoga-stha means being objective. One way to think about is if you become objective, you start looking at things from a third-person perspective, that's why consultation and security audit or financial is done by a third-party firm because they don't have any relation/attachment with the client. 

Read **[[Chapter 3]]**


[^1]: Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.
