Both the Pandavas and Kauravas side thought of peace and negotiating. Even Bhima who always was steadfast to attack, said that peace comes first when shove came to push. 
Duryodhana's mother, all the rishis, even Shakuni tells him to give the kingdom to Pandavas. 
But Duryodhana was adamant of not giving it back, no matter what. So eventually, just because of two people Duryodhana and Karna, entire BharatVarsha is plunged into a war. 

Even Shri Krishna and Vidhur told Dhritrashtra to imprison Duryodhana and save your family, but he is like what can I do?? If the war is going to happen let it be. He was not only blind through his eyes but also blind due to his Fatherly Love. 

- After seeing Arjuna panicking, Krishna is like what the hell you are doing in a battlefield, this isn't helping you in anyway, or you are going to heaven for this. 
- Leave this *Napunsakta*(impotency), stand up and get ready for battle. 
- But after listening to this, Arjuna became even more despondent. 
- He's like how can I kill my teacher. This war is anyways going to be a zero sum game, what is the point of even fighting the war?? 
- He asks a sure shot way to get over with this asap
- Then he says "Will not fight" and goes silent. 

Look both Pandavas(Arjuna) and Kaurvas(Duryodhan) were given a choice by Shri Krishna as both ask for help. Krishna offers army vs himself(Given, he will also not fight). Arjuna on the first choice choose Krishna over army, even when that would have led to reduction of power gap between Kauravas and Pandavas. **It teaches us that sometimes the choice is not always about the numbers.** 

- Atman is indestructible. It was always there. It was never born, it never died. So why do you care if you kill someone. You are just killing the body not the atman. 
	- Caveat: Its the intention to kill that will change whether you will inculcate *papa*(sin) or not. 
	- If you fight **without** caring about pain-pleasure, profit-loss but as for it is your duty as a Kshatriya to fight. Then you will go to *swarga*. 
	- Till now Shri Krishna was talking from a Vendantic Perspective. Then he started his discourse from Budhi Yoga or Karma Yoga Perspective.
	- Why did so because only having knowledge from BuddhiYoga perspective may prompt you to leave all your struggles and relations in this world in one go. [[text 39]]
	- What is the action you should take in a given situation?
	- Next Chapter [[Chapter 2 - Karma Yoga]]
- Like how we change clothes, atman changes bodies. 
- This body is a tool for doing dharma. Atman in itself cannot act as it is formless. 
- There are different ways of getting to that same goal. Puri zindagi nikal jaati hai pata nhi chalta purpose kya hai, its always in the hindsight we get to understand why it was there in the first place.
- Atman is that which makes us see, lets us hear, function our mind. 
- What is it that sees everything? 
	- What is that I? 
	- Who am I? 
- For the believers of empirical evidence, Atman, Paurush, Prakriti does not make sense. Purusa and Prakriti[^1]
