- How can being a Gyana Yogi lead to same outcome as Karma Yogi? 
	- For the Karma Yogi, the only reason to get detached from outcomes is because of the risk factor (Dvaita) involved. 
	- For a Gyana Yogi, He is a sanyasi, he has left all the worldly affairs anyways, so who cares about outcomes. 
	- But even if he is not a traditional Sanyasi, He can be a teacher or a person like me who is a scholar, then the understanding of what atman is and we are the atman and atman has no attachment with the worldly affairs would lead to same state as the Karma Yogi
