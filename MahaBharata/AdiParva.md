To be noted that we never loved poverty. We were always worshipper of Lakshmi. So everybody was encouraged to earn and use it for themselves, but with a sense of detachment. That's why Rajas used to give *dana* of so much land and wealth, because they never considered the resources for themselves but for everyone else around them. 

- Pandu was throned as Raja of Hastinapur as Vidhura was not part of direct lineage and Dhritrashtra was blind. 


Shakuni doesn't limp. Its just one of the folk tales and the television show just improvised his limping. Shakuni isn't against Hastinapur, he loves his nephew so much, that's why he helps Duryodhana. 

Pandu is married with daughter of Raja KuntiBhoj, Pritha. Its a very usual *swayamavara*, she likes Pandu and puts *haara* on him and marries him. 

Everybody used to have a lot of children, so if someone was not a able to conceive a baby, people used to adopt a child from chachi-chachi's family. 

Krishna's Dada is SoorSen.

Durvasa Muni's is known for his temper. Kunti Bhoj asks pritha to do Durvasa Muni's seva and Durvasa Muni being impressed by her Seva gives her the boon of a mantra which will help her summon any devata to conceive a baby. 

Note: Not all words starting from "Du" are bad. Durga means someone who you never come close to. Duryodhana means very difficult to defeat. Duhsashana means very difficult to be reigned in or put in control. Some people say that his name should be Suyodhana, yeah Krishna and Draupadi used that name in a mocking sense. 

DronaCharya asks for Guru Dakshina but he never tells what he really wants. Students hesitate, but our man *Arjuna* jumps in and tells Guru Drona, he may ask whatever, he will make sure that his wish is fulfilled.
