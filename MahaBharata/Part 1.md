# Legend around who wrote Mahabharata
- Beautiful legend around Mahabharata, not found in critical edition. 
- Ved Vyasa ji are constantly thinking about who is the right person to write Mahabharata, then Brahmaji comes to him and tell him that only Shri Ganesh are worthy enough to write MahaBharata.
- So Ved Vyasa went to Ganesha and asked him to write what he narrates. 
- Ganesha agrees but says that you have to narrate continuously without stopping otherwise I will stop writing 
- Ved Vyas agrees and puts forth his condition that Ganesha only write after he thoroughly understands what is being narrated. 

# Morality of Mahabharata
People says Mahabharata is grey in morality spectrum, there is no right and wrong. This is a fundamentally flawed perception because our morality is very different from western morality. Our benchmark comes from Dharama Sidhaanta. What may look bad according to western morality may not be the case when you look at from the perspective of Dharma. Whether morality is objective or not is debatable issue. 

It was made clear at the start of Mahabharata who acted acc. to Dharma and who did not. People keep saying that Mahabharata's morality is grey, but the problem is they are looking at it from the perspective of western ethics. But Mahabharata's ethics are based on Dharma not some western baseline. 

**Tree of Adharma**
- Dhritrashtra was the root of large tree of Adharma called Duryodhana and Karna was the trunk. Branches are Shakuni and Leaves, flowers are Duhshasana.
**Tree of Dharma**
- Tree of Dharma is Yudhistir, root is Krishna, Trunk is Arjuna, Bhim is branch and Sahdev, Nakul are flowers and leaves of the tree.

**Mahabharata is DharmaShastra, ArthaShastra and Kamashastra**

- Gita press version starts with Urgrashava Sauti telling to rishis in a place known as Naimish-aranaya, that he just came after listening to these very profound Upakhyanas written by Ved Vyasa at the SarpaSatra of Raja JanmaJaya (Great-Grandson of Arjuna)
- Trivia: Arjuna is Grandson of Ved Vyasa
- Janmajaya asks his ancestor Vyasa about his ancestory, why his ancestors fought. 
- He wanted to know about itihasa of his grandfathers 
- Ved Vyasa tells his disciple Vaishampayan to narrate the story. That's where Ugrashava Sauti listens to it and after that comes to Naimish-aranya and then narrates to disciples of Rishi Shaunak

So we got the version narrated in this hierarchy. 
Shri Krishnadvaipayan Ved Vyasa -> Vaishampayan -> Ugrashava Sauti -> Disciples of Rishi Shaunak -> ..... -> Then it comes to us.

>  Its always a good idea to study our texts at three levels

>  > 2. Adi Daivik

- Puranas deal with the Adi-Daivik level = Cosmic Level 
- The idea is that whatever happens at the Adi-Bhautik level is manifestation of some cause-effect at the Adi-Daivik level 
- That's why there's always a backstory at the cosmic level to whatever happens at the material level. 

# A side-story 
Dhritrashtra tries to justify himself in front of Sanjaya after the war ends and he learns that all his sons have died in the battlefield. He keeps giving excuses and keeps blaming others not himself.

# Fala-Shruti 
What happens when you study this shastra, you get punya equal to donating one thousand cows with golden horns. If a queen want sons, who are rulers, they should definitely study Mahabharata. Anybody who wants victory, who wants fame, who wants glory should read the mahabharata. Everything you need to know, you will find in this shastra to lead a fulfilling life. 

Whatever you find in Mahabharata, you will see that happening around you. If its not written in Mahabharata it will not be happening around you. (Level of confidence is astounding here.
# Back story of Ganga killing 7 sons
- Rishi Vasishtha gives shaapa to 8 Vasus that they will have to take birth on earth. 
- 7 vasus are killed by Ganga by drowning 
- 8th Vasu is left alive. 
	- Story 1: 8th vasu is ansha of all 7 vasus together
	- Story2: He's the head of Vasus deyayu who is specifically cannot go squat free. 
	- 8th Vasu is Deva-vrata or Bhishama Pitamaha

- Parshurama said that he will never train a Kshatriya but Bhishma can be seen as an exception here as may be Parshurama decided to teach him from his mother's side(Ganga).
