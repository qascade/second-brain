# Purpose of Studying Itihasa
- Don't just judge the characters of itihasa, learn from it. 
- You have to internalise them
- . Why was a certain decision or action taken?
- What would have been other actions that could have performed?
- What would have been downstream effects of these actions? 
- How can you apply the learnings obtained in your daily decision making processes?

# Purpose of Purana
- People usually put Itihasa and puranas together as a mythology 
- Although, Itihasa does have myths and metaphors, largely it is story of real past events and information
- Puranas are only written for the purpose of Bhakti 
- Pauranic Literature maybe seen as mythology 

> [!Note]
>  Itihasa was written by people who were contemporaries of the stories told in the texts written by them.
